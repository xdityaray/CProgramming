#C Programming: 111 C Programs (From Basics to Advanced)

A complete collection of 111 C programs covering every important topic in C programming, from input-output and loops to arrays, strings, and recursion.
This repository is ideal for anyone learning the C language, practicing coding, or preparing for interviews and exams.

#About This Repository

(1) This repository contains 111 C programming examples, written and organized systematically to help learners understand the core concepts of the C language.
(2) Each program is simple, well-commented, and designed to explain a particular concept step by step.
(3) The structure makes it easy for beginners to learn C from scratch and for intermediate learners to strengthen their logic and coding skills.
(4) You can run all the programs using Dev C++, Code::Blocks, or any other C compiler.

##Folder Structure

(1) BASICS & INPUT OUTPUT
(2) OPERATORS & DATA TYPES
(3) CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
(4) LOOPS (BASICS)
(5) LOOPS (ADVANCED)
(6) PATTERN PRINTING
(7) FUNCTIONS
(8) ARRAYS (BASICS)
(9) ARRAYS (INTERMEDIATE)
(10) ARRAYS (ADVANCED)
(11) 2D ARRAYS & MATRICES
(12) STRINGS
(13) RECURSION (ADVANCED)

Each folder includes several C language programs related to that topic, with clear code, comments, and logical structure.

##How to Run These C Programs (Using Dev C++)

(1) Open Dev C++ on your computer.
(2) Click on File â†’ New â†’ Source File.
(3) Copy the C program code and paste it into the editor.
(4) Save the file with a .c extension (for example, program1.c).
(5) Click on Execute â†’ Compile & Run or press F11.
(6) The output will appear in the console window.
(7) Modify inputs or logic to experiment and understand better.

##How to Download and Install Dev C++

(1) Go to the official SourceForge page:
ðŸ”— https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/

(2) Click the green Download button to get the Dev C++ setup file.
(3) Install it with default settings.
(4) After installation, open Dev C++ from your desktop or Start Menu.
(5) When prompted, select the TDM-GCC compiler (included with Dev C++).
(6) Create a new source file and start coding in C.

##Topics Covered in C Programming

(1) Input and Output Operations
(2) Data Types and Operators
(3) Conditional Statements (if, else, switch)
(4) Loops (for, while, do-while)
(5) Pattern Printing Programs
(6) Functions and Recursion
(7) Arrays and Matrices
(8) String Manipulation
(9) Logical, Mathematical, and Algorithmic Problems

This covers all major areas needed to learn C programming effectively.

##Purpose of This Project

(1) To practice and master C language programming through 111 examples.
(2) To create a structured and easy-to-follow list of C programs for beginners.
(3) To provide a helpful reference for students learning programming.
(4) To share open-source learning material for anyone interested in C programming.
