A collection of 111 C programs organized by topic, from basics to recursion.

# 111 C Programs (From Basics to Advanced)

This repository contains 111 C programs that I practiced while learning C programming, organized in a structured and progressive way.

## Folder Structure

(1) BASICS & INPUT OUTPUT  
(2) OPERATORS & DATA TYPES  
(3) CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS  
(4) LOOPS (BASICS)  
(5) LOOPS (ADVANCED)  
(6) PATTERN PRINTING  
(7) FUNCTIONS  
(8) ARRAYS (BASICS)  
(9) ARRAYS (INTERMEDIATE)  
(10) ARRAYS (ADVANCED)  
(11) 2D ARRAYS & MATRICES  
(12) STRINGS  
(13) RECURSION (ADVANCED)

Each folder contains programs with clear code and comments, covering concepts step by step.

## How to Run These Programs (Using Dev C++)

(1) Open Dev C++ on your computer.  
(2) Click on File → New → Source File.  
(3) Copy the C program code and paste it into the editor window.  
(4) Save the file with a .c extension. For example, `program1.c`.  
(5) Click on Execute → Compile & Run or simply press F11.  
(6) The output will appear in the console window below.  
(7) You can modify inputs or logic and re-run to observe different results.

## How to Download and Install Dev C++

(1) Open your web browser and go to the official SourceForge page:  
https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/  

(2) Click on the green "Download" button to download the Dev C++ setup file.  

(3) Once downloaded, open the setup file and follow the installation steps.  
Choose the default installation options when prompted.  

(4) After installation, open Dev C++ from your desktop or start menu.  

(5) When asked to select a compiler, choose "TDM-GCC" (this comes pre-installed with Dev C++).  

(6) Create a new source file and start writing your C programs.  

## About This Repository

(1) My goal was to learn C programming in a structured and practical way by writing code for every important topic.  
(2) I decided to practice 111 programs in total, starting from basic syntax and going up to recursion and matrix operations.  
(3) I organized all programs into 13 folders so learners can follow a clear and progressive learning path.  
(4) Each program includes comments and simple logic for better understanding.  
(5) Anyone starting with C programming can go through these folders and build their foundation step by step.

## Topics Covered

(1) Input and Output Operations  
(2) Data Types and Operators  
(3) Conditional Statements (if, else, switch)  
(4) Loops (for, while, do-while)  
(5) Pattern Printing  
(6) Functions (including recursion)  
(7) Arrays and Matrices  
(8) String Handling  
(9) Logical and Mathematical Problem Solving

## Purpose of This Project

(1) To strengthen my understanding of C programming through consistent practice.  
(2) To create a structured list of programs that can help other learners.  
(3) To demonstrate my progress and understanding of C through a complete collection of exercises.  
(4) To serve as a personal reference and resource for beginners.
